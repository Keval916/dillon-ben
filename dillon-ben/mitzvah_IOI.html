                                <span class="content_inner">At 13, a young Jewish person becomes obligated to observe the commandments of Judaism - all 613 of them. “Bar/Bat mitzvah” literally means “son/daughter of the commandment.” The "commandment" is to follow the laws of Judaism and pass those on for generations to come.</span>

                                <span class="content_inner">Judaism survives because the story of the Jews is retold year after year. We are not just talking about the story of the Jews' escape from slavery in Egypt which Jewish families around the world retell every year on Passover. This is just one of the stories that are told each year. The story of the Jews is the 5 books of the Torah - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. (In Christianity, this is referred to as the first 5 books of the Old Testament.)</span>

                                <span class="content_inner in_order_cls">A section of the week’s  <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">parsha</a> is read each  <a class="myBtn_multi"  href="javascript:void(0)">shabbat</a>, until the entire Torah is completed. This takes one full year. It is the responsibility of the Jewish adults in the community to tell this story by reading from the Torah each week.</span>

                                <span class="content_inner in_order_cls">Automatically, a boy becomes a bar mitzvah at the age of 13 and a girl becomes a bat mitzvah at 12. (Apparently God recognized that girls mature earlier than boys). As a bar/bat mitzvah, the young Jewish person is officially recognized as an adult in the eyes of the community and assumes the responsibility of an active Jew, which includes passing on the words of the Torah. Or, as Bar Mitzvah boys will tell you, “Today I am a man!”</span>

                                <span class="content_inner in_order_cls">In order to reach this milestone in their lives, Dillon and Ben have spent the last few years hard at work studying Hebrew and have learned to read and chant from the Torah. Today, they will read the parsha for this week from the Torah. This week’s portion is called Tzav. They will also read a haftarah and will deliver their <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">D’var Torah</a>, which is their interpretation and personal connection to the Torah portion they have read.

                                        <li>You can expect lots of Hebrew. Don’t worry, there is some English too, and all the prayers and readings are translated from Hebrew to English in the prayer book or siddur. You will either be handed one of these before you enter the sanctuary or you will find one at your seat so you can follow along. (BTW there are no assigned seats so sit wherever you want.)</li>

                                        <li>During the Torah service, the Torah scroll will be removed from the ark and processed around the congregation. You may see people kiss their prayer book or the corner of their tallit or prayer shawl and then touch it to the Torah. This is a sign of respect and love. If you are not Jewish, you do not have to do this.</li>

In Judaism, Shabbat begins at sundown on Friday night and ends at sundown on Saturday.

It is meant to be observed as a day of rest and as a day to abstain from any work. More observant Jews will refrain from any use of electronics on Shabbat. In today's world of iPhones, Androids, tablets, computers, smart TVs, Zoom calls, etc., taking a break from those devices is almost like a mini-vacation!</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner">The head covering worn by Jewish boys and men is called a <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">kippah</a>, or <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">yarmulke</a> in Yiddish. Orthodox Jews and some Conservative Jews wear one at all times. Most Conservative Jews and Reform Jews will wear one in the synagogue for services only.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner">In more liberal synagogues (like Beth El), women will often wear a head covering as well. This may be a hat or just a lace circle folded into quarters and secured with a bobby pin.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner in_order_cls">Just as men and women may be asked to remove their hats in church, or remove their shoes before entering a mosque, wearing a head covering is a non-denominational act of showing respect.

It looks like a regular shawl but has special knotted fringes (known as <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">tzitzit</a>) at the four corners.

                                    Because the braided fringes at the four corners of the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">tallit</a> remind its wearer to observe the commandments of Judaism, wearing a <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">tallit</a> is reserved for Jews. Although an usher may offer you a <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">tallit</a> at the door, you may decline it if you are not Jewish or are simply uncomfortable wearing such a garment.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner">The <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">shema</a> and its surrounding blessings are one of the two main sections of the Shabbat morning prayer service. The <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">shema</a> itself is one of the core prayers of Judaism containing the central monotheistic assertion of the Jewish faith.
                                    The second main section of the Shabbat morning prayer service is the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">amidah</a> or standing prayer. This consists of three different sections beginning with praise of God, leading into the middle section that celebrates the holiness and specialness of Shabbat, and concludes with prayers of thanksgiving and shalom.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner jewish">If you are not Jewish, the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">amidah</a> is a great time to quietly reflect on things which you find awe-inspiring, things with which you would like help, and things for which you are thankful.</span>

                                    <h3 class="color_text">TORAH SERVICE</h3>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_1">The Torah service is meant to be the climax of the service. Each Saturday morning, we relive the powerful moment at Mount Sinai when God revealed to Moses the entire Torah, with all its laws and the interpretations thereof, and God gave Moses the two stone Tablets containing the Ten Commandments.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_2">We go up to the Ark (the place we store our torahs) as if we are ascending Mount Sinai to receive the original Torah. We then break the weekly Torah reading, or <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">parsha</a>, into small sections. On Shabbat morning, we read 7 <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">aliyot</a>, plus one extra (called the Maftir).</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_3">A person or group of people will come upon the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">bimah</a> for an <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">aliyah</a>. This process of “coming up” is reenacting the role of Moses going up to the Torah and bringing its wisdom to the people.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_4">The Torah is a handwritten scroll that takes a special scribe approximately a year to write by hand, with a feather quill and ink.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_5">In addition to years spent learning to read the Hebrew, Dillon and Benjamin have spent the past year learning the special way to chant from the Torah. (BTW there are no vowels in the Torah!)</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_6">Just before the last section of the Torah is read, the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">cantor</a> will sing the Mi Shebeirach (MEE she-BAY-RACHK). The prayer asks for blessing, compassion, restoration, and strength within the community and for others who are ill, as well as for all Jews and all human beings.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_7">After the Torah readings are complete, Dillon and Ben will read the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">haftarah</a>. This week is a special Shabbat called Shabbat HaGadol (HAH-GAH-dole) - which translates to "The Great Sabbath." It is one of 4 special Sabbaths preceding the Passover Festival and therefore has a special <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">haftarah</a> text.</span>
                                    <span>They will follow this with their <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">D’var Torah</a>, and the rabbi(s) will follow with their sermon.</span>

                                    <h3 class="color_text">MUSAF SERVICE</h3>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_8">The Musaf (MOO-sahf) service is the final part of the Shabbat service. This includes a repetition of the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">amidah</a> followed by the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">Mourner’s Kaddish</a>. The rabbi will ask anyone in a period of mourning or observing a <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">yahrzeit</a> to rise. This allows the community to see who is standing, and perhaps give them an extra hug later.
                                    The Mourner's Kaddish is usually followed by some announcements, possibly another reading and/or prayer (usually the <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">Shehecheyanu</a>), the final prayer called Adon Alum (ah-DOHN ah-LUM), and, lastly, the priestly blessing.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_9">In honor of this SIMCHA, the entire congregation will then sing a celebratory song called “Siman Tov U’Mazel Tov” and wish each other a “Shabbat Shalom” as they leave the sanctuary.</span>

                                <p class="content">
                                    <span class="content_inner">It is customary for invited guests to give a gift to the bar/bat mitzvah celebrant. Presents should be delivered at the party or reception, rather than at the synagogue service. Most parties feature a gift table or other place designated for gifts.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner">What to give is based on both the person giving it and the soon-to-be-adult receiving it. Cash is undoubtedly convenient for all involved and can be used for something the bar/bat mitzvah child wants right now or socked away into savings accounts. Checks are traditionally written out in $18 increments, marking the Hebrew letters for the word <a class="myBtn_multi" href="javascript:void(0)">chai</a>, meaning “life.” (Each Hebrew letter has an associated numerical value. The numerical value of chai is 18.) That said, no one will be offended if you give a more rounded number, like $50 or $100 — or whatever you can comfortably afford.</span>

                                    <span class="content_inner class_1">A quick online search will offer other suggestions if you don’t want to do cash.
                                    Most importantly, don’t forget to attach a card or gift tag so it is clear who the gift is from. (Learning to write thank you notes is another by-product of becoming a bar/bat mitzvah.)</span>
